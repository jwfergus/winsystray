# winsystray
 Extremely simple Go windows system tray. 
 
 
 All code taken from hallazzang (below) and moved out into a simpler interface.
 
 Thanks to: https://github.com/hallazzang/go-tray-icons-tutorial

 Worth pointing out this library: https://github.com/getlantern/systray which currently has some issue w/ windows systray stuff randomly crashing, otherwise I would have just used that. https://github.com/getlantern/systray/issues/148
